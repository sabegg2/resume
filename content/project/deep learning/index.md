This is an example of one of many of my assignments in the coding bootcamp I took through the University of Denver in 2024. In this module challenge, we were tasked with using machine learning and neural networks to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants to a program will be successful. My github contains several other repositories for other assignments.
