        I taught in the Math Department at Western Washington University and Whatcom Community College for 5 years (2014-2019). Here is a list of courses I taught:
        
        - **MATH 112**: Algebra

        - **MATH 114**: Precalculus 1

        - **MATH 115**: Precalculus 2

        - **MATH 118**: Accelerated Precalculus

        - **MATH 124**: Calculus 1

        - **MATH 125**: Calculus 2

        - **MATH 224**: Multivariable Calculus 1

        - **MATH 309**: Proofs in Discrete Math

        - **Math&141**: Precalculus 1

        - **Tutoring**: Although I have now moved into industry, I still (as of 2024) teach math in the form of tutoring. I have a handful of local (Estes Park, CO) students, and I also hold AP calculus recitations for Zinkerz Tutoring Service, a Boston-based online education company that, among other things, provides test prep courses to students in South America.
